Gallagger
An arcade style game coded on java that is a fusion between a space shooter and an obstacle dodging game. The player is an avatar that shoots automatically but can only move in the spaces with platforms while static enemies shoot from the top of the screen. The objective is to eliminate all the enemies in the level while simultaneously dodging their bullets and staying on the platforms. Any time that the player takes any form of damage, either from being shot or moving somewhere without a platform, the avatar and board will be reset to their initial positions, but the enemies killed previously will stay dead, and the player will have 1 less life out of the 3 they have at the beginning of the game. The player can die 3 times before receiving a “game over” screen. Killing all enemies before losing the 3 lives the player has results in a “you win” screen.

Gallagger will be located in https://github.com/Willplayer1999/Group-26-project
<br>
There will be 6 classes that need to be grabbed from github for the command prompt version. They are: AnimationApp, Avatar Platform, Enemy, Bullet, and TextBase.
<br>
There will be 12 java files to grab. (Avatar, AvatarBullet, Bullet, Collidable, Enemy, EnemyBullet, Game, GUIGame, GUIGameInterface,  MovingPlatform, Platforms, and TextGame)
<br>
First they need to be compiled using javac. (Then the path directory to the location). Instead of doing each individual one, once you have reached the correct folder while in command prompt you can type javac *.java. This will compile everything in the folder.
<br>
After everything successfully compiles you can play one of two games. While in command prompt type Java TextGame for the command prompt version of the game (text base) or type Java GUIGame for the animated version of the game.

We have enjoyed creating this game for our project, and we hope you enjoy playing it as well. Good luck, and Have fun.
