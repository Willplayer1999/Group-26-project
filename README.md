Gallagger
An arcade style game coded on java that is a fusion between a space shooter and an obstacle dodging game. The player is an avatar that shoots automatically but can only move in the spaces with platforms while static enemies shoot from the top of the screen. The objective is to eliminate all the enemies in the level while simultaneously dodging their bullets and staying on the platforms. Any time that the player takes any form of damage, either from being shot or moving somewhere without a platform, the avatar and board will be reset to their initial positions, but the enemies killed previously will stay dead, and the player will have 1 less live out of the 3 they have. The player can die 3 times before receiving a “game over” screen. Killing all enemies before losing the 3 lives the player has results in a “you win” screen.

<br>
Gallagger will be located in https://github.com/Willplayer1999/Group-26-project
<br>
There will be 6 classes that need to be grabbed from github. They are: AnimationApp, Avatar Platform, Enemy, Bullet, and TextBase.
<br>
These 5 classes need to be in the same folder and ran through a command prompt.
<br>
First they need to be compiled using javac. (Then the path directory to the location)
<br>
After it successfully compiles type java TextBase and enjoy the game.
